# A-staring-robot
A robot that stares at you

This repository contains the code I wrote for Hack&Roll 2025:

* One ROS Module to process the LaserScan into motion tracking data
* Another ROS Module to pass commands from the PC to the EVN Alpha control brick
* An Arduino sketch for EVN Alpha (libraries imported by fully written by me, at https://github.com/EVN-devs/EVN-arduino)
* A half-complete Fusion design file for the chassis (because I closed my work without saving :/)
