A robot that stares at you

This repository contains the code I wrote for Hack&Roll 2025:

* A ROS Module to process the LaserScan into motion tracking data
* A ROS Module to pass commands from the PC to the EVN Alpha control brick
* An Arduino sketch for EVN Alpha (libraries imported by fully written by me, at https://github.com/EVN-devs/EVN-arduino)
